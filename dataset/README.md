# 🛰️ Labeled GOES-16 Satellite Images for River Inflow and Discharge Estimation

## 📌 Description
This dataset contains labeled satellite images acquired from the **GOES-16 satellite** and associated with **river inflow and discharge measurements** in the **Tietê River basin, Brazil**. The dataset was developed to support **machine learning and deep learning applications** in hydrological forecasting and remote sensing.

Each satellite image is linked to hydrological observations obtained from **streamflow gauging stations**, enabling **supervised learning approaches** for river inflow and discharge estimation.

The dataset includes **preprocessed satellite images**, **metadata describing monitoring stations**, and **labels containing inflow and discharge values**.

## 📍 Station Metadata

The file `stations_info.csv` provides metadata for the streamflow gauging stations used in this dataset, including:

- 🆔 Station identifier and station code  
- 🏞️ River basin and sub-basin  
- 🌊 Associated river  
- 📐 Geographic location (latitude and longitude)  
- ⛰️ Altitude and drainage area  

Geographic coordinates are provided in degrees, minutes, and seconds (DMS), following the original records from the Brazilian National Water Agency (ANA).

To ensure compatibility across different operating systems, programming languages, and data processing tools, accented characters were removed from the CSV files.
